This guide serves as a demonstration for creating a new container repository in https://quay.io[Quay]

== Prerequisites: 
Quay.io account - you can register for a Quay account https://quay.io/signin/[here]

Docker installed - follow Docker's https://docs.docker.com/install/[documentation] to find the correct installation for your system

== Step One: Create Repository
*_Click on "Create New Repository"_*

*_Set type to "Container Image Repository" and input a repository name. Optionally, add a description._*

*_Set the repository to public_*

---
*_Initialize as empty. Then click "Create Public Repository"_*

== Step Two: Build Container
Now that your container repository is setup, build your container. I'll be building a simple Apache web server, using a RHEL base image. You can find the Dockerfile https://github.com/RHC4TP/starter/blob/master/Container%20Zone/Examples/WebServer_Dockerfile_RHEL[here]. +

*_Build the Container_*
----
docker build . 
----
*_Run the Container_*
----
docker run -d -p 8080:80 <IMAGE ID>
----
*_Tag the active container to an image name_*
----
docker commit <CONTAINER ID> quay.io/username/repo
----

The method above describes creating an image based off an active container. If you'd like to build an image from the Dockerfile and tag it right away, try this:
----
docker build -t quay.io/username/repo . 
----

== Step Three: Push Container

== Step Four: Pull Container
